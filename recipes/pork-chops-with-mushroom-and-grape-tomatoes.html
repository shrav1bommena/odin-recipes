        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fairly quick and absolutely delicious way to have very juicy, 
            so-tender-you-can-cut-them-with-a-fork pork chops. 
            I use boneless chops that are 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick for this and keep the other sides simple; 
            it's great with baby red potatoes or rice. 
            I happened to have really great chops, and some fabulous veggies on hand so I kept the seasoning simple. 
            I used a rather strong Viognier for the wine, but you could use any good white.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (1 1/2 inches thick) boneless pork chops </li>
            <li>1 pinch seasoned salt, or to taste </li>
            <li>1 pinch lemon-pepper seasoning, or to taste </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li>1 cup white wine, divided </li>
            <li>½ cup water </li>
            <li>1 cup oyster mushrooms, pulled apart but not chopped </li>
            <li>½ green bell pepper, diced </li>
            <li>½ small onion, minced </li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li>½ cup grape tomatoes </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season pork chops with seasoned salt and lemon-pepper seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Add seasoned pork chops; cook until golden, 3 to 5 minutes per side. 
                Pour 1/2 cup wine and water over the pork chops; bring to a simmer. 
                Cook until chops are no longer pink in the center and most of the liquid has evaporated, 
                8 to 10 minutes. Transfer chops to serving plates.
            </li>
            <li>Stir oyster mushrooms, green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into the skillet. 
                Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often, until onion softens and all the liquid evaporates, 
                3 to 5 minutes. Add remaining 1/2 cup wine, tomatoes, and butter. Cook and stir until heated through, 
                1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Serve mushroom and tomato mixture over pork chops.
            </li>
        </ol>
